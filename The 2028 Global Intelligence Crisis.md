### 📌 **What the Report Is**

* The document was published by **Citrini Research** as a *scenario analysis* or *thought experiment*, not an official economic forecast. It’s sometimes referred to as **“The 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis.”** ([鉅亨網][1])
* It is framed from a hypothetical vantage point of **June 2028**, looking back at how the economy evolved since the mid-2020s under extreme AI adoption. ([鉅亨網][2])
* The report explores structural risks of rapid AI deployment, not what’s guaranteed to happen. ([The Online Citizen][3])

### 📊 **Core Scenario Highlights**

* **AI-Driven Automation Surge:** The report imagines autonomous AI agents replacing large swathes of white-collar work (e.g., coding, finance, professional services), dramatically reducing labor demand. ([鉅亨網][1])
* **“Ghost GDP” Concept:** Economic output continues to grow on paper (due to automation productivity) but doesn’t translate into *real* consumer spending, because displaced workers have less income. This creates a phenomenon the report calls *“ghost GDP.”* ([鉅亨網][2])
* **Labor Market Stress:** It simulates U.S. unemployment rising to ~10.2% by mid-2028 as AI substitutes for high-income roles, dragging down broad consumption. ([鉅亨網][2])
* **Market Impact:** In the scenario, major stock indices like the **S&P 500** are projected to fall sharply (e.g., ~-38% from peak) due to weakening demand, corporate defaults, and credit stress. ([鉅亨網][4])

### 📉 **Economic & Financial Mechanisms in the Scenario**

* **Feedback Loop without a Brake:** Wage declines reduce consumer demand, which prompts further AI adoption and job cuts, creating self-reinforcing contraction rather than a typical cyclical recession. ([The Online Citizen][3])
* **Credit and Mortgage Risks:** Consumer income weakness and defaults on private credit are woven into the scenario’s deterioration. ([Cointelegraph][5])
* **SaaS & Tech Pressure:** Automated coding and AI agents hypothetically compress software pricing and renewal rates, hurting enterprise software models. ([EconoTimes][6])

### 📉 **Real-World Market Reaction**

* Although the scenario is explicitly hypothetical, it has **gone viral and affected markets**, contributing to broad sell-offs in software, payment, and tech stocks. ([AAStocks][7])
* Indices such as the Dow Jones and Nasdaq have seen downward pressure on the day it circulated. ([鉅亨網][1])

### 🧠 **Expert Response & Critiques**

* Some economists and commentators appreciate the scenario as a *stress test* for AI risk assessment. ([Business Insider][8])
* Others argue the report’s extreme assumptions — including sustained consumption collapse and lack of policy response — are *improbable* or overly pessimistic. ([Financial Times][9])

### 📝 **Summary**

* The *Citrini Research* “2028 June scenario analysis” is a **fictional yet detailed thought exercise** focused on long-term AI structural risks.
* It is not a prediction but a stress-tested narrative that has nonetheless resonated with investors and media, triggering market volatility.
* The report’s overarching theme: *if AI’s adoption outpaces human economic adaptation, it could create complex macroeconomic feedback loops with deep consequences.*
